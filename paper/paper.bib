              cell-cycle regulation, cellular shape, motility, differentiation
              and apoptosis. The human protein kinome contains 518 members.
              Most studies that focus on the human kinome require, at some
              point, the visualization of large amounts of data. The
              visualization of such data within the framework of a phylogenetic
              tree may help identify key relationships between different
              protein kinases in view of their evolutionary distance and the
              information used to annotate the kinome tree. For example,
              studies that focus on the promiscuity of kinase inhibitors can
              benefit from the annotations to depict binding affinities across
              kinase groups. Images involving the mapping of information into
              the kinome tree are common. However, producing such figures
              manually can be a long arduous process prone to errors. To
              circumvent this issue, we have developed a web-based tool called
              Kinome Render (KR) that produces customized annotations on the
              human kinome tree. KR allows the creation and automatic overlay
              of customizable text or shape-based annotations of different
              sizes and colors on the human kinome tree. The web interface can

              disease, affecting approximately 1\% of the adult population
              worldwide, with an estimated heritability of 60\%. To identify
              genes involved in RA susceptibility, we investigated the
              association between putative functional single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs) and RA among white individuals by use of a
              case-control study design; a second sample was tested for

              with the minor allele of a missense SNP in PTPN22
              (discovery-study allelic P=6.6 x 10(-4); replication-study
              allelic P=5.6 x 10(-8)), which encodes a hematopoietic-specific
              protein tyrosine phosphatase also known as ``Lyp.'' We show that
              the risk allele, which is present in approximately 17\% of white
              individuals from the general population and in approximately 28\%
              of white individuals with RA, disrupts the P1 proline-rich motif

              these proteins' normal function as negative regulators of T-cell

              phosphorylation and most cellular processes. To better understand
              the global roles of protein phosphorylation, we cataloged the
              human protein phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted
              human protein phosphatase genes. We also identified 79 protein
              phosphatase pseudogenes or retrogenes, some of which may have
              residual function. We traced the origin and diversity of
              phosphatases by building protein phosphatomes for eight other
              eukaryotes, from the protist Dictyostelium to the sea urchin. We
              classified protein phosphatases from all nine species into a
              hierarchy of 10 protein folds, 21 families, and 178 subfamilies.
              We found that >80\% of the 101 human subfamilies were conserved
              across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in
              evolution, including losses and expansions of individual

              phosphatases show similar evolutionary dynamics to those of
              kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms.
              Sequence analysis predicts that 26 human protein phosphatase
              domains are catalytically disabled and that this disability is
              mostly conserved across orthologs. This genomic and evolutionary

  abstract = "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B (CMT4B) is a severe,
              demyelinating peripheral neuropathy characterized by distinctive,
              focally folded myelin sheaths. CMT4B is caused by recessively
              inherited mutations in either myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2) or
              MTMR13 (also called SET-binding factor 2). MTMR2 encodes a member
              of the myotubularin family of phosphoinositide-3-phosphatases,
              which dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P)
              and bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2. MTMR13 encodes a large,
              uncharacterized member of the myotubularin family. The MTMR13
              phosphatase domain is catalytically inactive because the
              essential Cys and Arg residues are absent. Given the genetic
              association of both MTMR2 and MTMR13 with CMT4B, we investigated
              the biochemical relationship between these two proteins. We found
              that the endogenous MTMR2 and MTMR13 proteins are associated in
              human embryonic kidney 293 cells. MTMR2-MTMR13 association is
              mediated by coiled-coil sequences present in each protein. We
              also examined the cellular localization of MTMR2 and MTMR13 using
              fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. We found
              that (i) MTMR13 is a predominantly membrane-associated protein;
              (ii) MTMR2 and MTMR13 cofractionate in both a light membrane
              fraction and a cytosolic fraction; and (iii) MTMR13 membrane
              association is mediated by the segment of the protein which
              contains the pseudophosphatase domain. This work, which describes
              the first cellular or biochemical investigation of the MTMR13
              pseudophosphatase protein, suggests that MTMR13 functions in
              association with MTMR2. Loss of MTMR13 function in CMT4B2
              patients may lead to alterations in MTMR2 function and subsequent
              alterations in 3-phosphoinositide signaling. Such a mechanism
              would explain the strikingly similar phenotypes of patients with
              recessive mutations in either MTMR2 or MTMR13.",

              for all 38 human PTP genes. In addition, we identified 12 PTP
              pseudogenes unique to humans that have probably contaminated
              previous bioinformatics analysis of this gene family. PCR

              that enables complex queries pertaining to kinase disease
              involvement and potential therapeutic uses of kinase inhibitors.
              RESULTS: Here, we present KinMap, a user-friendly online tool
              that facilitates the interactive navigation through kinase
              knowledge by linking biochemical, structural, and disease
              association data to the human kinome tree. To this end,
              preprocessed data from freely-available sources, such as ChEMBL,
              the Protein Data Bank, and the Center for Therapeutic Target
              Validation platform are integrated into KinMap and can easily be
              complemented by proprietary data. The value of KinMap will be
              exemplarily demonstrated for uncovering new therapeutic
              indications of known kinase inhibitors and for prioritizing
              kinases for drug development efforts. CONCLUSION: KinMap
              represents a new generation of kinome tree viewers which
              facilitates interactive exploration of the human kinome. KinMap
              enables generation of high-quality annotated images of the human

              scientific communications. Furthermore, KinMap supports multiple
              input and output formats and recognizes alternative kinase names
              and links them to a unified naming scheme, which makes it a
